    *   https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/search/tweets</a>.
    *
    * @param query : The search query of 500 characters maximum, including operators.
    *              Queries may additionally be limited by complexity.
    * @param count : By default it is `15`.
    *              The number of tweets to return per page, up to a maximum of 100.
    * @param include_entities : By default it is `true`.
    *                         The parameters node will be disincluded when set to `false`.
    * @param result_type : By default it is `Mixed`.
    *                    Specifies what type of search results you would prefer to receive.
    *                    Valid values include:
    *                    - `Mixed`: Include both popular and real time results in the response.
    *                    - `Recent`: return only the most recent results in the response
    *                    - `Popular`: return only the most popular results in the response.
    * @param geocode : Optional, by default it is `None`.
    *                Returns tweets by users located within a given radius of the given latitude/longitude.
    *                The location is preferentially taking from the Geotagging API, but will fall back to their Twitter profile.
    *                Note that you cannot use the near operator via the API to geocode arbitrary locations;
    *                however you can use this geocode parameter to search near geocodes directly.
    *                A maximum of 1,000 distinct “sub-regions” will be considered when using the radius modifier.
    * @param language : Optional, by default it is `None`.
    *                 Restricts tweets to the given language. Language detection is best-effort.
    * @param locale : Optional, by default it is `None`.
    *               Specify the language of the query you are sending (only `ja` is currently effective).
    *               This is intended for language-specific consumers and the default should work in the majority of cases.
    * @param until : Optional, by default it is `None`.
    *              Returns tweets created before the given date.
    *              Keep in mind that the search index has a 7-day limit.
    *              In other words, no tweets will be found for a date older than one week.
    * @param since_id : Optional, by default it is `None`.
    *                 Returns results with an ID greater than (that is, more recent than) the specified ID.
    *                 There are limits to the number of Tweets which can be accessed through the API.
    *                 If the limit of Tweets has occured since the since_id, the since_id will be forced to the oldest ID available.
    * @param max_id : Optional, by default it is `None`.
    *               Returns results with an ID less than (that is, older than) or equal to the specified ID.
    * @param callback : Optional, by default it is `None`.
    *                 If supplied, the response will use the JSONP format with a callback of the given name.
    *                 The usefulness of this parameter is somewhat diminished by the requirement of authentication for requests to this endpoint.
    * @return : The representation of the search results.
